    "At its heart, we are using `func_adl` to run C++. This is an abstraction. And givin how complex ATLAS software is, the abstraction is bound to leak. One very messy place it leaks is when things go wrong. And it leaks in two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first way is that `ServiceX` is a distributed processing system. And collecting errors in an appropriate way from 100's of processors is not trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way it leaks is that when something goes wrong with the generated C++, `ServiceX` just passes back the error logs, leaving it up to the user. This section tries to list some of the errors that are seen, showing some examples, and also the appropriate course of action to take."

The software will give you a pretty clear error.\n",
